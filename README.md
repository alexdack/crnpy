# crnpy
 A project to build a Python library to simulate Chemical Reaction Networks.

# To install the lib
1) Clone the repo from github
2) cd into the crnpy/crnpy/ folder and run 'python setup.py bdist_wheel'
3) cd into the newly created /dist folder and run 'pip install crnpy-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl'

Note: In the future I might upload to the online Pip repo so you can just pip install crnpy
